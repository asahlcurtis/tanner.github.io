<p>Hi, so I thought I would make this aboslute war crime of a website <br> to just archive or show off the stuff I've been doing.
	<br> So if you are reading this, I am so very sorry you had to see this. <br> Anyway, I have my fair share of years learning programming so I made this.</p>
	
<hr color="black">
	
<p>So you might wonder what this will have in it. Well, I plan to put stuff like drawings, <br> animations, games, doom mods, conlangs, and other stuff I might want to write down.<br></p> <hr color="black">
<p>Also if you are wondering why this website looks like this. I am kinda shooting for an old 90s blog thing<br>mainly because I don't really like modern website design. And I prefer to code instead of build on wix.</p>
