<p>Hi, so I thought I would make this aboslute war crime of a website <br> to just archive or show off the stuff I've been doing.
	<br> So if you are reading this, I am so very sorry you had to see this. <br> Anyway, I have my fair share of years learning programming so I made this.</p>
	
<hr color="black">
	
<p>So you might wonder what this will have in it. Well, I am planning to put stuff like drawings, <br> animations, maybe games, doom mods, conlangs, and other stuff I might want to write down.</p>

	
<p> <a href="Doom mods.html">See my doom mods here!</a> </p>
<p> <a href="Conlangs.html">See my conlangs here!</a></p>
